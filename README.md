# json

A single-file JSON parser written as an experiment in Test Driven Development.

You can see the development on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1ssMPpyqocicj5gxqpPDA1iZu9OX3YBT).

My aim is never to have to publish to Maven Central, instead just include the [current source file](./src/main/kotlin/com/oneeyedmen/json/json.kt) in your project.
