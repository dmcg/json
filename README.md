# json

A single-file JSON parser written as an experiment in Test Driven Development.

You can see the development on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1ssMPpyqocicj5gxqpPDA1iZu9OX3YBT).

My aim is never to have to publish to Maven Central, instead just include the current source file in your project.
